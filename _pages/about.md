I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor is Professor [Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Satya)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/).
I am broadly interested in edge computing, distributed systems, databases, video analytics, and systems of/by/for machine learning. I currently focus on video analytics systems on the edge. I work on [Elijah](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/) <small>(cloudlet-based edge computing)</small> and [Eureka](https://github.com/fzqneo/eureka-yfcc100m) <small>(interactive image search and visual machine learning)</small>.

Before joining CMU, I received my M.Phil and B.S in Computing from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University,where I researched hardware-conscious database operations with Professor [Eric Lo](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo) <small>(now at CUHK)</small>.

I am a recipient (among seven) of the [Croucher Foundation Doctoral Scholarship](https://croucher.org.hk/funding/study_awards/scholarships) in 2017.
